# Tasks Manager

I tend to plan my weeks using a concrete methodology, I do it weekly. After using some of the tasks managers available in the market, 
none of them fited with my workflow. Thus, I decided to create my own tool to be more *productive* and *organized*.

This repository includes all the files of the project. The stack I have used for this side project is:

- Ionic 2 (Angular 2)
- Firebase

Itâ€™s not available right now, but if you want to use it, feel free to contact me and I will will tell you how to install and use it.
